I made my first portfolio website using HTML, CSS And JavaScript.

********* 1920 * 1080 is better to use ************ I made my first portfolio website using HTML, CSS And JavaScript. actually its a demo, no backend done. only front-end designed. It's not a screen(display) size-responsive , the alignments will vary with your display ratio. In further projects, I definitely fixed that and makes more responsible.
